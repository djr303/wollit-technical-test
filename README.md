# Wollit technical test | Written by David Roberts

Tested in NodeJS v12.16.3, Yarn v1.22.4 & Chrome latest

# TODOs

* Suitable unit tests for all server side and client side logic
* DRY approach across the code base

# Notes on future work

* The server implementation uses a few simple abstractions to work with a flat file database. If I had more time I would use Docker compose to have one container for the server code and a MongoDB instance and another container for the React application
